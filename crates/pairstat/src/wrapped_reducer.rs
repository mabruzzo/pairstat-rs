/// # Dynamic Dispatch vs "Enum Dispatch"
///
/// There isn't a particularly strong reason behind our choice of dynamic
/// dispatch. We summarize some considerations down below, but we are very
/// willing to change the implementation.
///
/// Our initial choice was primarily influenced by some concerns about an
/// enum-dispatch approach:
/// - I was originally concerned that enum-dispatch may not work very well
///   with the dynamic plugin approach (for GPU support) that is briefly
///   described in the module-level documentation of [`crate::accumulator`].
///   Upon reflection, I realized that if [`AccumulatorDescr`] continues to
///   treat the [`Config`] type in a similar way to its current treatment
///   (i.e. the [`Config`] instance is stored alongside the [`WrappedReducer`]
///   that was constructed from it and serves as the "source-of-truth" for
///   serialization). **In other words, this isn't a significant concern.**
/// - My main concern focuses on readability and maintainability:
///   - there are "a lot" of Reducer variations to support. Combinatorics from
///     generic types (especially when we want to make different choices for
///     structure functions and correlation functions), significantly increase
///     the number of variations...
///   - Let's consider what it takes to add a new reducer:
///     - under the current system, we just need to update [`build_registry`].
///     - under an enum-system, we would need to update
///       - [`build_registry`] (or whatever equivalent we shift to using).
///       - The enum-system would also have equivalent methods for each method
///         that this trait currently declares (there are 5 at the time of
///         writing), and there would be a match statement over all variants.
///         We would need to update the variant in every method.
///     - while we could potentially use macros to reduce code duplication, I
///       worry about readability
///       - to be fair, we do now use a macro in [`WrappedIrregularHist`].
///         With that said, this covers very special cases (that we may want
///         to consider removing...).
///       - if we don't remove [`WrappedIrregularHist`], we would need to have
///         special handling in the enum-dispatch approach for these special
///         cases (which could significantly complicate the macros)
/// - At a surface-level, it might seem like the enum-system would let us
///   remove all machinery to make [`Config`] implement the [`Eq`] trait
///   (namely, the machinery to implement bin-edge equality checks)
///   - in practice, that isn't really true.
///   - performing equality checks for distance edge bins and Histogram
///     reducers requires us to implement the vast majority of this machinery
///     anyway.
///
/// There are some other considerations:
/// - do we want to support a future where external code can implement new
///   Reducers? (At the moment, we don't)
/// - is the performance benefit of enum-dispatch significant
///   - I'm sketipical, at the moment
///   - But, I could totally see it being more important if we supported
///     multiple reducers per accumulator.
///
/// Importantly, I'm happy to be proven wrong and change our approach. If
/// anybody wants to implement an enum-dispatch approach, I would happily
/// consider it!
