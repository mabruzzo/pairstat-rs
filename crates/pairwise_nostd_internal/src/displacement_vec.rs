/// We probably want to avoid exposing this type publicly. If we decide to
/// publicly expose it, we may want to re-draft the documentation for the
/// type and its methods (we need to disentangle what the type represents
/// and what is an implementation detail)
///
/// The language here could also be improved.

///
/// TODO: reframe this as a 3D index offset, that could theoretically apply
/// to any 2 3D arrays (in the context of CartesianBlock, it corresponds to
/// a spatial offset)
///
/// This type is only meaningful when you have 2 `CartesianBlock` references,
/// block_a and block_b; (they may reference the same block or 2 distinct
/// blocks). In this context, the type represents a displacement (mathematical)
/// vector, in units of indices, between a point in block_a and a point in
/// block_b (we sometimes call this a separation vector).
///
/// At a high-level, if you have a pair of points from block_a and block_b
/// separated by a displacement vector, then adding the displacement vector to
/// the position of the point in block_a gives the position of the point in
/// block_b. This description glosses over a few thorny details related to
/// coordinate systems, which we sort out down below.
///
/// # Coordinate Systems
///
/// Coordinate systems become relevant when block_a and block_b describe
/// different regions of space. 3D indices used to access local values or
/// weights normally use coordinate-systems defined locally to the block. We
/// can also consider a "global index space." In other words, imagine that
/// blocks a and b are concatenated with other blocks to make a single global
/// block.
///
/// Let's define the "global displacement vec" as describing the displacement
/// between 2 points in the "global index space." We define the
/// "local_displacement_vec" as the vector you can add to the position of the
/// from block_a, in block_a's local coordinate system, to get the position of
/// the point in block_b, in block_b's local coordinate system.
///
/// These `i`th component of these quantities are related by:
/// ```text
/// total_displacement_vec[i] =
///   local_displacement_vec[i] +
///   (block_b.start_idx_global_offset[i] - block_a.start_idx_global_offset[i])
/// ```
///
///
/// As you can see, when block_a and block_b reference the same block, there is
/// no difference between these quantities.
///
/// # Ideas for Improvement:
/// - can we come up with a better name than local_displacement_vec?
/// - maybe we introduce this idea of local-vs-global coordinate systems
///   elsewhere? In the documentation of [`CartesianBlock`] or maybe we add
///   some higher-level narrative docs (maybe at the module-level) to
///   introduce the concept?
